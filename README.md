# TETRICE

This game is a version of Tetrice for the Alice 32 micro computer.

It is written in C and compiled using the [CC68](https://github.com/EtchedPixels/CC6303/tree/master) compiler.

It has been developed mostly using the [DCAlice](http://alice32.free.fr/) emulator, as well as [My First Alice32 Emulator](http://www.emu-france.com/emulateurs/10-ordinateurs/244-matra-hachette-alice32/2335-my-first-alice32-emulator/).

It has also been tested from time to time on real hardware (Alice 32). Please note that this game requires an Alice 32 or Alice 90, it does **not** work on the original Alice model based on the Tandy MC10.

## How to use

Run `make` to build the executable: `tetrice.k7`.

The `k7` file can then be loaded as a cassette tape in an emulator; or converted to WAV to be loaded on a real machine.

## How to play

- `O` : left
- `P` : right
- `A` and `Z` : rotate
- Space bar : accelerate / drop

## Demo video

Here is a short Webm of the gameplay using DCAlice.
